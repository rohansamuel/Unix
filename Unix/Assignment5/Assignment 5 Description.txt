In this project, i used the $RANDOM generator to generate number between 1 and 128. The random number was stored in variable rand. The I initialized a variable called num_guess to keep track of the number of users guess. Each time, the user enters number, the num_guess will get updated by num_guess+1. To validate the number with the user, I used if else statements. If user number equals rand number, user wins. Else if the number is higher,  (-gt), the rand number is high guess, else low guess. In the text file, it will contain the name and num_guess of users attempt. I used sort method to sort the numbers.
